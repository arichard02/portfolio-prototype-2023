            <h2>Planning & Discovery</h2>
            <div>
                <p>In our planning and analysis phase, our goal was to figure out who
                    would be coming to the website, what these users wanted / needed, and what features we should we
                    build. After researching, planning, and meeting with our client, we created a list of features and
                    enhancements, which included:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Clarifying their message (who they are and what they do)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Conveying a feeling of power, excellence, and excitement
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Highlighting their fundraising campaign
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Showcasing the AUX “Tenants”
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Telling the story / timeline of the AUX
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Methods</h3>
                <p>We analyzed the existing AUX website and similar ones -<br>
                    like The Phoenix (Milwaukee) -
                    to determine what was working and what wasn't. <br>
                    Also looked at their existing marketing materials
                    (e.g. news articles, videos, social media, etc.)
                    Interviewed the client - got the client's input regarding what
                    they were looking for, look and feel,
                    timeline, communication style, etc.</p>
                <h3>Methods</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Creating an interview guide
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Organizing and conducting needs assessment and feedback meetings, asking follow-up /
                        clarifying questions, and
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Note-taking
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Debriefing / compiling the findings from the interview with the team.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Defining Requirements</h3>
                <p>From our internet research / client interview, we create a list of requirements (which are
                    high-level tasks that the software should support). These included:
                    We learned wo was in charge (lol)
                    Looked at websites; transferred their info to the new website. Looked at what we liked / didn't
                    like.
                    Divided up the tasks and created a design each.
                    Don't try and do everything you want to do - do their requirements first:
                    Equity Campaign (invest & donate on every page)
                    Timeline + Thermometer
                    Tenant Profiles
                    Got their 'buy-in' for modifications to their existing website.

            <h2>Design</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>Methods</h3>
                <p>Low-fidelity prototyping (Google Slides)
                    We started with google slides to come up with ideas re: how we wanted the website to look.
                    Using Google slides, we created the first step for a plan of action for each page – what we wanted
                    each
                    page to say / be about and look like.
                    Shared out and discussed the designs.
                    Generated a lot of ideas quickly.
                    High-fidelity prototyping (Figma + WordPress)
                    Esther gave us a Figma workshop and a WordPress Elementor Workshop
                    Used Figma and Elementor to prototype / explore features and ideas
                    Sharing and discussing design decisions as a team
                </p>
                <h3>Skills / Tools</h3>
                <p>
                    Google Slides
                    Figma
                    Simplifying the text / messaging
                    Working with online stock image providers (Pexel, Unsplash, etc.).
                    Slack
                    Working with WordPress templates and widgets (Elementor, Royal Elementor, ElementsKit, etc.)
                    Trello – project management tool. Helps keep projects organized. And you know who’s doing what (we
                    tried
                    to use this, but ended up mostly using email...which is fine, given the scope of our projects)?
                    Designing and/or working with a style guide / branding kit.
                </p>
                <h3>How did we stay organized?</h3>
                <p>Email reminders
                    Each week making sure everyone had a task
                    SCRUM Weekly meetings / ceremonies(?)</p>

            <h2>Development</h2>
            <div>
                <p>After we came up with the designs / templates / widgets, we created the actual pages and posts, using
                    the content provided, and created a unified look and feel.</p>
                <h3>Methods</h3>
                <p>Designed the information architecture of the website (what is most important, less important).
                    Designed the communication and flow of the website.
                    Implemented the Wordpress site on a live server.</p>
                <h3>Description of the Process</h3>
                <p>Figuring out the skeleton and the order
                    What pictures to use
                    Shortened the content (b/c ppl usually skim websites versus reading all of the content)
                    Prepared to meet and get feedback.</p>

            <h2>Evaluation</h2>
            <div>
                <p> After we created our V1 prototype, we sent our link to the client for feedback.
                </p>
                <h3>Methods</h3>
                <p>Met / emailed with the client to presented our first version prototype
                    Compiled feedback
                    Created a list of next steps / follow-up tasks (collaboratively)
                </p>
                <p>We created three different versions of the website throughout our design process.</p>
                <h3>Version 1</h3>
                <p>After the first round of feedback, our client liked the structure of the website and our design
                    concept, but wanted more color and vibrancy.
                    Design: more color; made sure to follow the style guide.</p>
                <h3>Version 2</h3>
                <p>Timeline: taking critical feedback and creating new versions
                    Re-structured the news page to showcase different sections - press, featured and news
                    Fundraising – thermometer
                    Updated content / pics</p>
                <h3>Version 3</h3>
                <p>Managing the customers via nagging :). Putting fake info to prompt a response.
                    Quote “customer may not know what they want, but they definitely know what they don’t like”. So we
                    possibly can say we sketched different options for them to review, and adjust the directions every
                    time
                    we talk to them.</p>

            <h2>Deployment & Handoff</h2>
            <div>
                <p> To deploy the site, we helped the client sign up with a hosting
                    provider (GoDaddy) and exported /
                    imported the WordPress site to the live server. We also ensured that the
                    WordPress site was secure, that it was being
                    backed up, and that all images were uploaded to a cloud hosting provider. Finally, we created
                    training videos and a maintenance plan for the website handoff.
